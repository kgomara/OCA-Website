		"description":	"The vast majority of software projects suffer from a steady degradation of design quality and it becomes more and more difficult to maintain the software with the same level of quality. As the software ages it calcifies and becomes harder and harder to maintain. In some cases it becomes too expensive to maintain and so it the software is put to rest and rewritten. In others, the software is released with a steadily increasing number of defects. Both of these common situations are deeply unsatisfying, but there is another way.",
